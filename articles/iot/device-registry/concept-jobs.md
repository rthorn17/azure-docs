#Customer intent: As an IoT solution architect, I want to understand how Azure Device Registry jobs target groups and run software updates so that I can plan, run, and monitor fleet-scale operations.

# Jobs concepts (preview)

Use *Jobs* to define and run actions on devices at fleet scale. An Azure Device Registry job runs against a collection of devices that can span multiple IoT hubs in the same Azure Device Registry namespace.

[!INCLUDE [Relationships between groups, jobs, and software updates](includes/groups-jobs-software-updates.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Device Registry jobs are currently in preview.

## Job scope

Azure Device Registry jobs are a namespace-level resource. A job doesn't belong to an individual IoT Hub&mdash;it applies to devices across every hub in the namespace that the job's target group selects. This removes the individual hub as the unit of fleet management and lets you operate on devices consistently regardless of which hub they're connected through.

## Relationship to groups and software updates

A job definition identifies:

- The **task** to run.
- The **target**: either a group (for a software update job) or the namespace itself (for an onboarding update job).
- The **update configuration**: the software update artifact to apply.

The target group and the software update artifact referenced by a job must already exist before you create a software update job. For more information about defining a target, see [Groups concepts (preview)](concept-groups.md). For more information about preparing an update artifact, see [Software updates concepts (preview)](concept-software-updates.md).

## Supported job types

This preview supports two software update job types:

| Job type | Target | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Software update | An Azure Device Registry group | Applies a software update to every compatible device in the target group. |
| Onboarding update | An Azure Device Registry namespace | Applies a software update to compatible devices before they become operational in Azure Device Registry. Such devices initially connect to the update endpoint rather than to IoT Hub. |

## Execution model

- You can run a job on demand or schedule it to run later.
- In this preview, you can start each job definition once. A continuous software update rollout can remain active after it starts and continue processing eligible devices.
- Job definition states are: `Ready`, `Failed`, and `Creating`.
- Job run states: `Scheduled`, `Running`, `Canceled`, and `Failed`.
- Individual device states within a job are: `Succeeded`, `Failed`, and `In progress`.

### Retry

After a job completes with device failures, you can retry the job on the failed devices in one action. The retry targets only devices that failed and doesn't affect devices that already completed the job successfully.

## Monitoring

Both the Azure portal and Azure CLI support managing and monitoring jobs. Monitoring includes:

- Device-level results for each device targeted by the job.
- Counts of successful and failed updates.

## Limits

- The current limit is 50 concurrent `Scheduled` and `Running` job runs.
