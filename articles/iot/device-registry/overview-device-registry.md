# What is Azure Device Registry?

Azure Device Registry is a unified registry that represents your IoT devices and assets as Azure Resource Manager resources. By projecting devices and assets into the Azure control plane, Azure Device Registry gives you a consistent way to deploy, govern, query, and secure them by using the same tools you already use for other Azure resources.

Azure Device Registry works with both Azure IoT Operations and Azure IoT Hub (integration with Azure IoT Hub is currently in preview), so you can manage devices and assets across your edge and cloud solutions through a single, uniform interface.

Azure Device Registry is the common Azure control plane for your IoT estate. The core resource model&mdash;namespaces, devices, and assets&mdash;is generally available for Azure IoT Operations and in preview for Azure IoT Hub. Building on this shared model, Azure Device Registry adds schema registries and management actions for Azure IoT Operations, and preview capabilities for IoT Hub-connected devices that include certificate management, groups, jobs, and software updates.

## Azure Device Registry as the control plane

Traditionally, you manage IoT devices through service-specific data planes that are separate from the Azure management plane. Azure Device Registry closes that gap by representing each device and asset as an Azure Resource Manager resource with its own resource ID. This approach extends the Azure control plane to your IoT estate and provides:

- **Unified governance**: Apply role-based access control (RBAC), tags, resource groups, and Azure Policy to devices and assets the same way you do for other Azure resources.
- **At-scale querying**: Use Azure Resource Graph to query devices and assets across services, subscriptions, and regions.
- **Consistent operations**: Perform metadata updates, auditing, and lifecycle management through a single interface instead of per-service tools.

Because devices and assets are Azure Resource Manager resources, they participate in the standard Azure deployment, policy enforcement, and logging experiences.

## Azure Device Registry capabilities

Azure Device Registry organizes and manages your IoT estate through the following capabilities. Namespaces, devices, and assets form the shared foundation across Azure IoT services. Schema registries and management actions apply to Azure IoT Operations, and certificate management, groups, jobs, and software updates apply to IoT Hub-connected devices. Capabilities are generally available unless marked as preview.

### Namespaces

A *namespace* is a management and organizational boundary for devices and assets in Azure Device Registry. Every device and asset belongs to exactly one namespace. A namespace groups related devices and assets, establishes a security boundary, and supports management at scale through RBAC, tags, and policies.

Each Azure IoT Operations instance or Azure IoT Hub maps to a single namespace, and multiple instances or hubs can share one namespace for broader management scenarios. To learn more, see [What is an Azure Device Registry namespace?](concept-namespaces.md) For guidance on planning namespaces, see [Best practices for Azure Device Registry namespaces](best-practices-namespaces.md).

### Devices and assets

Azure Device Registry represents both *devices* and *assets* as Azure Resource Manager resources:

- **Devices** are the IoT devices connected to your solution, such as the devices that Azure IoT Hub manages or the devices connected through Azure IoT Operations.
- **Assets** are the physical or logical items in your environment, such as OPC UA servers or industrial equipment connected through Azure IoT Operations.

When you represent devices and assets as Azure Resource Manager resources, you can govern, tag, and audit them consistently through the Azure control plane.

### Schema registries

A *schema registry* is a feature of Azure Device Registry that stores the definitions of messages coming from edge assets. Schema registries support Azure IoT Operations scenarios, where data flows use schemas to describe, transform, and serialize messages. For guidance on planning schema registries, see [Best practices for Azure Device Registry schema registries](best-practices-schema-registries.md).

### Certificate management

Certificate management is a feature of Azure Device Registry that enables you to issue, renew, and revoke X.509 certificates for your IoT Hub-connected devices through a Microsoft-backed certificate authority. By managing certificates through Azure Device Registry, you can handle the full certificate lifecycle for IoT Hub-connected devices from the Azure control plane. Certificate management for IoT Hub-connected devices is currently in preview. For more information, see [What is certificate management in Azure Device Registry?](../iot-certificate-management-overview.md)

### Groups, jobs, and software updates

Azure Device Registry provides groups, jobs, and software updates so that you can operate on IoT Hub-connected devices at fleet scale. These capabilities are currently in preview:

- **Groups** organize IoT Hub-connected devices into query-defined sets that you target with fleet-scale operations. For more information, see [Groups concepts (preview)](concept-groups.md).
- **Jobs** run namespace-wide operations, such as software updates, against a group of devices that can span multiple Azure IoT Hub instances. For more information, see [Jobs concepts (preview)](concept-jobs.md).
- **Software updates** prepare update artifacts and deploy standard or onboarding updates to devices through groups and jobs. For more information, see [Software updates concepts (preview)](concept-software-updates.md).

For production software update workloads, use [Device Update for IoT Hub](../../iot-hub-device-update/understand-device-update.md), which is generally available.

### Management actions

Management actions let you invoke operations on the southbound assets connected to your Azure IoT Operations instance, such as calling methods and reading or writing values. Each Azure Device Registry namespace can map to an Azure Event Grid instance, which provides consistent routing for these operations. You can invoke management actions from the edge by using MQTT, or from the cloud by using Azure Resource Manager APIs, Bicep files, and templates. For more information, see [Enable and run management actions](../../iot-operations/discover-manage-assets/howto-use-management-actions.md).

### Azure IoT Operations

In Azure IoT Operations, Azure Device Registry is generally available and manages the devices and assets connected at the edge. Azure Device Registry represents assets discovered and onboarded through Azure IoT Operations, where you can manage them alongside your other Azure resources. For more information, see [What is asset and device management in Azure IoT Operations?](../../iot-operations/discover-manage-assets/overview-manage-assets.md).

### Azure IoT Hub

In Azure IoT Hub, Azure Device Registry integration is in preview. Azure Device Registry represents each Azure IoT Hub device as an Azure Resource Manager resource, which enables management across multiple Azure IoT Hub instances through shared namespaces. Azure Device Registry provides certificate management for IoT Hub-connected devices, enabling you to issue, renew, and revoke X.509 device certificates from the Azure control plane. For more information, see [Integration with Azure Device Registry (preview)](../../iot-hub/iot-hub-device-registry-overview.md) and [What is certificate management in Azure Device Registry?](../iot-certificate-management-overview.md).

In Azure IoT Hub, Azure Device Registry uses groups and jobs to enable bulk software updates for IoT Hub-connected devices, letting you deploy and manage updates across many devices efficiently. These capabilities are currently in preview.
